# 🧠 Text Generation App

This project is a simple **Streamlit web app** that generates text using a machine learning or deep learning model.  
It allows users to input a prompt and receive AI-generated responses in real time.

---

## 🚀 Features
- Interactive web interface built with **Streamlit**
- Text generation using a trained or pre-trained model (e.g., GPT-2, LSTM, or custom model)
- User-friendly layout with instant response
- Supports local deployment via virtual environment (`venv`)

## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone this repository

git clone https://github.com/omrohitchannoji/Text_Generation.git
cd text-generation-app

### 2. Create and activate a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate      # for Windows
# OR
source venv/bin/activate   # for macOS/Linux

### 3. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

### 4. Run the Streamlit app
streamlit run app.py

🧠 Model Info

The notebook text_generation.ipynb demonstrates how the text generation model was trained, tested, or fine-tuned.
You can export or load your trained model in the Streamlit app for interactive use.
