🧠 Text Generation App

An interactive AI-powered text generator built with Streamlit and Python.
This project allows users to input any text prompt and receive smart, coherent AI-generated responses — powered by modern NLP models such as GPT-2 or custom-trained deep learning models.

🚀 Features

✨ Real-time text generation using pre-trained models
🧩 Built with Streamlit for an intuitive and interactive UI
⚙️ Easily customizable for your own NLP models
📊 Includes a Jupyter Notebook for model experimentation and fine-tuning
💻 Lightweight, easy to run locally with a virtual environment

⚙️ Installation & Setup
1️⃣ Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/text-generation-app.git
cd text-generation-app

2️⃣ Create and activate a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate      # for Windows
# OR
source venv/bin/activate   # for macOS/Linux

3️⃣ Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

4️⃣ Run the Streamlit app
streamlit run app.py


Then open the displayed local URL (e.g., http://localhost:8501) to view your app!

🧠 Model Overview

The model behind this app generates text predictions based on an input prompt.
You can:

Train or fine-tune your model in text_generation.ipynb

Export the model weights

Load them into the Streamlit app for real-time text generation

You can also replace it with any Hugging Face model by adjusting your app code.

🌍 Deployment Options

You can deploy your app for free on:

Streamlit Cloud

Hugging Face Spaces

Render
